In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are: - R

\- Python

\- Matlab

## Data Science Languages

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

1.  **Python** - Widely used for its readability and extensive libraries.
2.  **R** - Known for its statistical analysis and data visualization capabilities.
3.  **SQL** - Essential for querying and managing relational databases.

## Data Science Libraries

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

1.  **Pandas** - Provides data structures and data analysis tools.
2.  **NumPy** - Supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
3.  **Scikit-learn** - Offers simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
4.  **TensorFlow** - A framework for machine learning and deep learning.
5.  **Matplotlib** - Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## Arithmetic Expression Examples

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.

# Define the numbers

a = 5 b = 10

# Multiply and then add

multiplication = a \* b addition = a + b

# Display the results

multiplication, addition


```{r}
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

# Number of minutes
minutes = 200

# Convert minutes to hours
hours = minutes / 60

# Display the result
hours

```
**Objectives**

- Learn to use JupyterLite Notebook for creating and sharing data science projects.
- Understand how to use markdown cells for documentation and code cells for calculations.
- Get familiar with common data science tools and libraries.
- Practice converting units and performing basic arithmetic operations in Python.
- Explore how to use GitHub for version control and sharing projects.
